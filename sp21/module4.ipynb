Sometimes you would collect this data yourself through observation or perhaps the data is given\nto you like in Data 8, but what if you're starting a new project and you have no data to begin with? In that\ncase, you would have to find this data yourself. Where would you even begin to start with the task of finding\ndata?! Thankfully, it's a lot easier now than you think!\n\nOne of the first resources that we recommend diving into is [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) which is\na large central repository of datasets. You can find topics such as [COVID-19](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge)\nand the [MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) dataset for more traditional sort of projects or\neven fun topics like [Pokemon statistics](https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon) and [Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)\ndataset.\n\nAnother way to search for datasets is to just [Google](https://www.google.com/) for datasets that you want!\nGoogle even has a [dataset search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) feature built by Google's\nresearch department that can help narrow down results to actual datasets rather than the full collection of\nhuman knowledge that Google provides.\n\nFinally, there are domain specfic dataset sources that you can use. For example, for genome data, one can use\n[NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/) to source everything. There's also Reddit's [r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/)\nto further source information and to try and find domain specific knowledge.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"0c3fa5cd-a483-4491-8451-8369a37bf2ca","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Reading in data files with pandas\n\ninclude link","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"2ca03d0a-0751-41b3-80bc-8700185b37db","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The data that you find online can come in several different forms, the most common of which being csv. \ncsv files are just comma separated data files, and in pandas, there's a specific function for reading in csv files:\n\n`df = pd.read_csv(file_path)`\n\nSimilar to csv files are tsv files. tsv files are the same structure as csv files, but the data is separated by tabs. \nTo read in tsv files in pandas, we again use the `read_csv` function:\n\n`pd.read_csv(file_path, sep='\\t')`\n\nThe sep = '\\t' just signifies that the file is seperated by tabs instead of the default \",\".\n\nSome other file types you might run into in your search for data are xlsx files, json files, and html files. \nLuckily in pandas, there's a specific function to read each of these files into a Data Frame. \n\nFor xlsx files, use:\n`df = pd.read_excel(file_path)`\n\nFor json files, use:\n`df = pd.read_json(file_path)`\n\nFor html files, use:\n`df = pd.read_html(file_path)`","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"9bb10b94-e744-45ee-99cf-895f1df812f4","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"5fa1dd4d-ee27-4755-aecf-4876a62071a0","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first step of EDA is determining the \"shape\" of our data. \nIn general, rectangular structures tend to be easier to manipulate and analyze, and data cleaning often involves getting our data into a rectangular shape.","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"4c54beb8-621d-4d0c-86c8-3204c3643145","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n\nIn this section, we will be working with the [2016 Global Ecological Footprint](https://www.kaggle.com/footprintnetwork/ecological-footprint) dataset from Kaggle. \nThe following description can be found from the website:\n\n*The ecological footprint measures the ecological assets that a given population requires to produce the natural resources it consumes (including plant-based food and fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber and other forest products, space for urban infrastructure) and to absorb its waste, especially carbon emissions. The footprint tracks the use of six categories of productive surface areas: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up (or urban) land, forest area, and carbon demand on land.*\n\n*A nation’s biocapacity represents the productivity of its ecological assets, including cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land. These areas, especially if left unharvested, can also absorb much of the waste we generate, especially our carbon emissions.*\n\n*Both the ecological footprint and biocapacity are expressed in global hectares — globally comparable, standardized hectares with world average productivity.*\n\n*If a population’s ecological footprint exceeds the region’s biocapacity, that region runs an ecological deficit. Its demand for the goods and services that its land and seas can provide — fruits and vegetables, meat, fish, wood, cotton for clothing, and carbon dioxide absorption — exceeds what the region’s ecosystems can renew. A region in ecological deficit meets demand by importing, liquidating its own ecological assets (such as overfishing), and/or emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If a region’s biocapacity exceeds its ecological footprint, it has an ecological reserve.*","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"592d034b-d49c-4137-84cf-e4c75fdef4ac","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"}},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"tags":[],"cell_id":"dfe85617-ab96-4f50-96e8-5f0edf3974d4","output_cleared":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"source":"countries
