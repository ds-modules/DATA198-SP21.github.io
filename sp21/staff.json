You may have seen me teaching at other EECS and Math classes as well, and I hope everyone will have an enjoyable semester with us (as I'm sure you will learn a lot in 198)! I usually spend my time doing applied math research and volunteering in different clubs. Before quarantine, you probably will spot me at the swimming pool or at YiFang waiting for my boba on weekends. I look forward to seeing you all (online..) this spring and in person soon when we are back at school."
